## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I enhanced my skills in creating responsive designs using Flexbox and CSS Grid. One particular area of focus was ensuring that all interactive elements provided clear feedback through hover states. For instance, I implemented the following hover effect for buttons:

```css
.buttons .btn.ios:hover {
    opacity: 0.8; 
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.5), 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.3); 
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my CSS skills, particularly in animations and transitions to make the user interface more dynamic. Additionally, I want to explore JavaScript to add interactivity to future projects, such as implementing a real clipboard functionality.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This site helped me understand Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts better.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A great resource for understanding HTML5 and CSS3 specifications.
